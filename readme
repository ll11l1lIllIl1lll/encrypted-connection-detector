A toy that attempts to identify encrypted connections, with an accuracy rate comparable to randomly flagging 69% of traffic. All code generated by ChatGPT.

usage:
  -forward string
        target address to forward to (host:port)
  -listen string
        port to listen on (default "1080")

Establishe local SOCKS5 proxy which listen on the specified port. In the event that a forwarding option is provided, the port will be redirected to the specified destination instead of being set up as a proxy.

The aforementioned description is sufficient for this repository, but of course further useless texts can be provided.

It is noteworthy that this tool has shown a markedly elevated detection rate for traffic utilising the vmess+tcp encryption protocol combination in comparison to other traffic types, This behaviour is also observed in the vmess+ws. This indicates the possibility of efficacy in detecting vmess traffic, although further investigation and verification are essential. It is important to note that this observation is based on limited testing and may not be generalisable to all vmess+ws implementations or network environments.

Furthermore, this tool is designed to intentionally avoid the analyzing of TLS-encrypted connections. Given the pervasive use of TLS, this tool is designed to focus on the analysis of traffic that may employ other encryption methods.

Disclaimer: that this toy has been generated with the use of ChatGPT and it is not intended for use in any production environment. Prior to implementation, it is imperative that the code be subjected to a comprehensive review and testing process. The author of this repository accepts no liability for any issues or damages that may arise from the utilisation of this code.
